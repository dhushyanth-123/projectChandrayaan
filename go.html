            <h2>Why We Initiated This Website ? </h2>
            <p>
                We built this website as the effort for the teamwork of 4 member. First of all, its a school group activity or project that 
                let you to think about Chandrayaan (the pride of india) and its step-by-step success. We will unfold the secrets of its success.
            </p>
            <h2>Laying the Foundation</h2>
            <p>
                Chandrayaan-1, India's maiden lunar mission, was launched on October 22, 2008. Equipped with a suite of scientific 
                instruments, including an impact probe, a Moon Impact Probe (MIP), and a Moon Impact Probe (M3), the spacecraft aimed 
                to map the Moon's surface in detail, study the distribution of elements and minerals, and explore the presence of water 
                molecules in the polar regions.

                One of Chand rayaan-1's most significant achievements was the discovery of water molecules on the lunar surface, 
                challenging conventional scientific wisdom and indicating the possibility of water ice in permanently shadowed 
                regions. This revelation had profound implications for future lunar exploration and potential human habitation.
            </p>
            <h2>A Leap Forward</h2>
            <p>
                Building upon the success of Chandrayaan-1, ISRO embarked on a more ambitious mission, Chandrayaan-2, which 
                comprised an orbiter, a lander named Vikram, and a rover named Pragyan.Launched on July 22, 2019, this 
                mission aimed to explore the Moon's south polar region and further investigate the presence of water and its distribution.

                While the orbiter successfully continued its scientific observations, the lander's descent did not go as planned, 
                and communication with it was lost. Despite the setback, the 
                orbiter continues to yield valuable data about the Moon's surface, exosphere, and mineral composition. 
                Chandrayaan-2 demonstrated ISRO's engineering prowess and its capacity to 
                take on complex missions, even in the face of challenges.
            </p>
            <h2>The Future Beckons</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, ISRO is contemplating the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which aims to focus solely on landing a rover on 
            the Moon's surface. This represents another step in India's journey toward 
            lunar exploration, emphasizing its determination to overcome past hurdles and expand its scientific footprint.</p>
            <h2>Significance and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The Chandrayaan missions hold immense significance, both for India and the global scientific community. They have 
                contributed to advancing our knowledge of the Moon's composition, origin, and potential for sustaining life. 
                The discovery of water molecules on the lunar surface has opened doors to future exploration and the possibility of 
                using the Moon as a resource for future space endeavors, including potential human colonization and space travel.

                Moreover, the Chandrayaan missions have underscored India's capability in space technology. 
                The successful execution of complex missions on a relatively modest budget showcases ISRO's 
                cost-effectiveness and innovation, making it a model for other nations to emulate.

            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                <h2>  Chandrayaan-1</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Orbiter: The heart of the mission, the orbiter, was equipped with scientific instruments to observe 
                    the Moon from a distance. It played a crucial role in mapping the lunar surface, 
                    studying its composition, and identifying potential landing sites for future missions.</li>

                    <li> Impact Probe (MIP): Mounted on the orbiter, the MIP was designed to detach and impact the lunar surface. 
                    It carried instruments to study the Moon's thin exosphere and transmitted 
                    data back to the orbiter before impact.</li>
                    
                    <li>Moon Impact Probe (MIP): Mounted on the orbiter, the MIP was designed to detach and impact the 
                    lunar surface. It carried instruments to study the Moon's thin exosphere and transmitted 
                    data back to the orbiter before impact.</li>
                    
                    <li>Moon Impact Probe (MIP): Mounted on the orbiter, the MIP was designed to detach and impact the 
                    lunar surface. It carried instruments to study the Moon's thin exosphere and transmitted 
                    data back to the orbiter before impact.</li>
                    
                    <li>Moon Impact Probe (MIP): Mounted on the orbiter, the MIP was designed to detach and impact the 
                    lunar surface. It carried instruments to study the Moon's thin exosphere and transmitted 
                    data back to the orbiter before impact.</li>
                    
                    <li> Space Network (DSN): A ground-based network of antennas that enabled communication with the orbiter 
                    and other mission components. It allowed ISRO to receive data from the spacecraft and send commands.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>  Chandrayaan-2</h2>
                <u1>
                    <li> Orbiter: Similar to Chandrayaan-1, the orbiter in Chandrayaan-2 was equipped with advanced instruments to 
                        study the Moon's surface and exosphere. It also served as a communication link with the lander and rover.</li>

                    <li>Vikram Lander: The lander was designed to make a soft landing on the lunar surface near the south pole. 
                        It housed the Pragyan rover and carried scientific instruments to analyze the composition of the lunar surface.</li>

                    <li>Pragyan Rover: Housed within the Vikram lander, the rover was designed to traverse the lunar surface, conducting 
                        detailed experiments and collecting data about the Moon's geological and mineralogical properties.</li>

                    <li>Communication System: An intricate network of antennas and communication devices facilitated data transmission between 
                        the mission components and the ISRO ground stations.</li>

                    <li>Deep Space Network (DSN): Just as in Chandrayaan-1, DSN played a pivotal role in maintaining communication with the 
                        Chandrayaan-2 components as they journeyed to and explored the Moon.</li>
                </u1>
                <h2>  Chandrayaan-3</h2>
                <p>
                    Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar 
                    surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion 
                    module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of 
                    Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.
                    Chandraâ€™s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic
                    Activity (ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its 
                    variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA is accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.Alpha Particle X-ray 
                    Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclution</h2>
                <p>
                    Chandrayaan represents India's aspiration to explore the cosmos and contribute to humanity's understanding of the universe. Through these missions, 
                    India has demonstrated its scientific acumen, technological prowess, and commitment to pushing the boundaries of space exploration. As ISRO continues 
                    to refine its space capabilities and prepare for future missions, the Chandrayaan legacy will undoubtedly remain a beacon of inspiration for generations 
                    to come.
